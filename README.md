# FinalProject "AutoWorld" <br>
*A project for my Lexicon utbildning where the goal was to Build a Car shop website using C# in backend and ASP.NET in the frontend with MVC* <br>
**The project is a simple CRUD project with different roles** 
*The user will be able to brows the site for cars available where there is some details available such as picture of the car, model, brand, the agent resposable of the car with their details to contact then.
As an authentecaed user in the site such as a staff or agent you will be able to edit information about the cars, delete and even add new car that will be showen in the website for everyone.
The home page contain a navigation to help the user navigate through the site and a simple image slider
The on the right side of the navigation can show different type of informations, normally the website will show a login button but this function will only be available for authentecated users to login and be able to edit on the website.
